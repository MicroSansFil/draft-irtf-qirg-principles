   <abstract>
     <t>The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance Internet
     technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on
     Earth.  To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack must be built from
     the ground up as the physical nature of the communication is fundamentally
     different.  The first realisations of quantum networks are imminent, but
     there is no practical proposal for how to organise, utilise, and manage
     such networks.  In this memo, we attempt lay down the framework and
     introduce some basic architectural principles for a quantum internet.
     This is intended for general guidance and general interest, but also to
     provide a foundation for discussion between physicists and network
     specialists.</t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>Quantum networks are distributed systems of quantum computers that
     utilise fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition,
     entanglement, and quantum measurement to achieve capabilities beyond what
     is possible with classical networks.  This new networking paradigm offers
     promise for a range of new applications such as tamper-proof
     communications <xref target="bennett14"></xref>, distributed quantum
     computation <xref target="crep02"></xref>, and quantum sensor networks
     <xref target="giov04"></xref>.  The field of quantum communication has
     been a subject of active research for many years and the most well-known
     application of quantum computers that has already been deployed, quantum
     key distribution (QKD), is a protocol used for secure communications.</t>

     <t>Fully quantum networks capable of transmitting and managing entangled
     states in order to send, receive, and manipulate distributed quantum
     states are now imminent <xref target="castel18"></xref> <xref
     target="wehner18"></xref>.  Whilst a lot of effort has gone into
     physically connecting the devices and bringing down the error rates there
     are no concrete proposals for how to run these networks.  To draw an
     analogy with a classical network, we are at a stage where we can
     physically connect our devices and send data, but all sending, receiving,
     buffer management, connection synchronisation, and so on, must be managed
     by the application itself at what is essentially assembly level.
     Furthermore, whilst physical mechanisms for forwarding quantum states
     exist, there are no protocols for managing it.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Model of computation">
     <t>In order to understand the framework for quantum networking a basic
     understanding of quantum information is necessary.  The following sections
     aim to introduce the bare minimum necessary to be understand the
     principles of operation of a quantum network.  This exposition was written
     with a classical networking audience in mind.  It is assumed that the
     reader has never before been exposed to any quantum physics.</t>

     <section title="Qubit">
       <t>The differences between quantum computation and classical computation
       begin at the bit-level.  A classical computer operates on the binary
       alphabet { 0, 1 }.  A quantum bit, a qubit, exists over the same binary
       space, but unlike the classical bit, it can exist in a so-called
       superposition of the two possibilities:</t>

       <t>a |0> + b |1>,</t>

       <t>where |X> denotes a quantum state, here the binary 0 and 1, and the
       coefficients a and b are complex numbers called probability amplitudes.
       Physically, such a state can be realised using a variety of different
       technologies such as electron spin, photon polarisation, atomic energy
       levels, and so on.</t>

       <t>Upon measurement, the qubit loses its superposition and irreversibly
       collapses into one of the two basis states, either |0> or |1>.  Which of
       the two states it ends up in is not deterministic.  The probability of
       measuring the state in the |0> state is |a|^2 and similarly the
       probability of measuring the state in the |1> state is |b|^2.  This
       randomness is not due to our ignorance of the underlying mechanisms, but
       rather it is a fundamental feature of a quantum mechanical system <xref
       target="aspect81"></xref>.</t>

       <t>The superposition property plays an important role in fundamental
       gate operations on qubits.  Since a qubit can exist in a superposition
       of its basis states, the elementary quantum gates are able to act on all
       states of the superposition at the same time.  For example, consider the
       NOT gate:</t>

       <t>NOT (a |0> + b |1>) -> a |1> + b |0>.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Multiple qubits">
       <t>When multiple qubits are combined in a single quantum state the space
       of possible states grows exponentially and all these states can coexist
       in a superposition.  For example, the general form of a two qubit
       register is</t>

       <t>a |00> + b |01> + c |10> + d |11></t>

       <t>where the coefficients have the same probability amplitude
       interpretation as for the single qubit state.  Each state represents a
       possible outcome of a measurement of the two qubit register.  For
       example, |01>, denotes a state in which the first qubit is in the state
       |0> and the second is in the state |1>.</t>

       <t>Performing single qubit gates affects the relevant qubit in each of
       the superposition states.  Similarly, two qubit gates also act on all
       the relevant superposition states, but their outcome is far more
       interesting.</t>

       <t>Consider a two qubit register where the first qubit is in the
       superposed state (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and the other is in the state |0>.
       This combined state can be written as:</t>

       <t>(|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) x |0> = (|00> + |10>)/sqrt(2),</t>

       <t>where x denotes a tensor product (the mathematical mechanism for
       combining quantum states together).  Let us now consider the two-qubit
       CNOT gate.  The CNOT gate takes as input two qubits, a control and
       target, and applies the NOT gate to the target if the control qubit is
       set.  The truth table looks like</t>

       <texttable>
         <ttcol align="center">IN</ttcol>
         <ttcol align="center">OUT</ttcol>
         <c>00</c><c>00</c>
         <c>01</c><c>01</c>
         <c>10</c><c>11</c>
         <c>11</c><c>10</c>
       </texttable>

       <t>Now, consider performing a CNOT gate on the ensemble with the first
       qubit being the control.  We apply a two qubit gate on all the
       superposition states:</t>

       <t>CNOT (|00> + |10>)/sqrt(2) -> (|00> + |11>)/sqrt(2).</t>

       <t>What is so interesting about this two-qubit gate operation? The final
       state is *entangled*.  There is no possible way of representing that
       quantum state as a product of two individual qubits, they are no longer
       independent and their behaviour cannot be fully described without
       accounting for the other qubit.  The states of the two individual qubits
       are now correlated beyond what is possible to achieve classically.
       Neither qubit is in a definite |0> or |1> state, but if we perform a
       measurement on either one, the outcome of the partner qubit will
       *always* yield the exact same outcome.  The final state, whether it's
       |00> or |11>, is fundamentally random as before, but the states of the
       two qubits following a measurement will always be identical.</t>

       <t>Once a measurement is performed, the two qubits are once again
       independent.  The final state is either |00> or |11> and both of these
       states can be trivially decomposed into a product of two individual
       qubits.  The entanglement has been consumed and if the same measurement
       is to be repeated, the entangled state must be prepared again.</t>
     </section>
   </section>

   <section title="Entanglement as the fundamental service">

     <t>Entanglement is the fundamental building block of quantum networks.  To
     see this, consider the final state from the previous section:</t>

     <t>(|00> + |11>)/sqrt(2).</t>

     <t>Neither of the two qubits is in a definite |0> or |1> state and we need
     to know the state of the entire register to be able to fully describe the
     behaviour of the two qubits.</t>

     <t>Now consider sending one of the qubits to another device.  This device
     can be anywhere: on the other side of the room, in a different country, or
     even on a different planet.  Provided negligible noise has been
     introduced, the two qubits will forever remain in the entangled state
     until a measurement is performed.  The physical distance does not matter
     at all for entanglement.</t>

     <t>This lies at the heart of quantum networking, because it is possible to
     leverage these non-classical correlations in order to design completely
     new types of algorithms that are not possible to achieve with just
     classical communication.  Examples of such applications are quantum
     cryptography, blind quantum computation, or distributed quantum
     computation.</t>

     <t>As a trivial example consider the problem of reaching consensus between
     two nodes.  The two nodes want to agree on the value of a single bit.  In
     a quantum network they can simply request the network to generate the
     state (|00> + |11>)/sqrt(2) for them and that is essentially all that
     needs to be done.  Once any of the two nodes performs a measurement the
     state of the two qubits collapses to either |00> or |11> so whilst the
     outcome is random, the two nodes will always measure the same value.  We
     can also build the more general multi-qubit state (|00...> +
     |11...>)/sqrt(2) and perform the same algorithm between an arbitrary
     number of nodes.</t>

     <t>However, it is impossible to entangle two qubits without ever having
     them directly interact with each other (e.g. by performing a local
     two-qubit gate, such as the CNOT).  A local interaction is necessary to
     create entanglement and thus such states cannot be created between two
     quantum computers that cannot transmit quantum states to each other.
     Therefore, it is the entanglement property of multi-qubit states that
     draws the line between a genuine quantum network and a collection of
     quantum computers connected over a classical network.</t>

     <t>A quantum network is defined as a collection of nodes that is able to
     distribute entangled states amongst themselves.  A quantum computer that
     is able to communicate classically with another quantum computer is not a
     member of a quantum network.</t>

     <t>This is a crucial difference between classical and quantum networks.
     Classical applications transmit data over the network to synchronise
     distributed state.  Quantum network applications obtain distributed
     states, synchronised at the physical level via entanglement, from the
     network to perform quantum algorithms.</t>

     <t>More complex services and applications can be built on top of entangled
     states distributed by the network.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Achieving quantum connectivity">
     <section title="No-cloning theorem">
       <t>To build a network we must first physically connect all the nodes
       with quantum channels that enable them to distribute the entanglement.
       Unfortunately, our ability to transfer quantum states is complicated by
       the no-cloning theorem.</t>

       <t>The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an
       identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state.  Since performing
       a measurement on a quantum state destroys its superposition, there is no
       practical way of learning the exact state of a qubit in an unknown
       state.  Therefore, it is impossible to use the same mechanisms that
       worked for classical networks for error-correction, amplification,
       retransmission, and so on as they all rely on the ability to copy the
       underlying data.  Since any physical channel will always be lossy,
       connecting a quantum network is a challenging endeavour and its
       architecture must at its core address this very issue.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Direct transmission">
       <t>The most straightforward way to distribute an entangled state is to
       simply transmit one of the qubits directly to the other end across a
       series of nodes while performing sufficient error correction to bring
       losses down to an acceptable level.  Despite the no-cloning theorem and
       the inability to directly measure a quantum state error-correcting
       mechanisms for quantum communication exist <xref
       target="mural14"></xref>.  However, even in the most optimistic
       scenarios the hardware requirements to fault-tolerantly transmit a
       single qubit are beyond near-term capabilities.  Nevertheless, due to
       the promise of fault-tolerance and its favourable poly-logarithmic
       scaling with distance, this may eventually become a desirable method for
       entanglement distribution.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Bell pairs and entanglement swapping">
       <section title="Bell Pairs">
         <t>An alternative relies on the observation that we do not need to be
         able to distribute any arbitrary entangled quantum state.  We only
         need to be able to distribute any one of what are known as the Bell
         Pair states.  Bell Pair states are the entangled two-qubit states:</t>

         <t>
           |00> + |11>,<vspace blankLines="0" />
           |00> - |11>,<vspace blankLines="0" />
           |01> + |10>,<vspace blankLines="0" />
           |01> - |10>,
         </t>

         <!-- <texttable> -->
         <!--   <ttcol align="center">Bell Pairs</ttcol> -->
         <!--   <c>|00> + |11></c> -->
         <!--   <c>|00> - |11></c> -->
         <!--   <c>|01> + |10></c> -->
         <!--   <c>|01> - |10></c> -->
         <!-- </texttable> -->

         <t>where the constant 1/sqrt(2) normalisation factor has been ignored
         for clarity.  Any of the four Bell Pair state above will do as it is
         possible to transform any Bell Pair into another Bell Pair with local
         operations performed on only one of the qubits.  That is, either of
         the nodes that hold the two qubits of the Bell Pair can apply a series
         of single qubit gates to just their qubit in order to transform the
         ensemble between the different variants.</t>

         <t>Distributing a Bell Pair between two nodes is much easier than
         transmitting an arbitrary quantum state over a network.  Since the
         state is known error-correction is easier and error-detection combined
         with reattempts becomes a valid strategy.</t>

         <t>The reason for using Bell Pairs specifically as opposed to any
         other two-qubit state, is that they are the maximally entangled
         two-qubit set of basis states.  Maximal entanglement means that these
         states have the strongest non-classical correlations of all possible
         two-qubit states.  Furthermore, since single-qubit local operations
         can never increase entanglement, less entangled states would impose
         some constraints on distributed quantum algorithms.  This makes Bell
         Pairs particularly useful as a generic building block for distributed
         quantum applications.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Teleportation">
         <t>The observation that we only need to be able to distribute Bell
         Pairs relies on the fact that this enables the distribution of any
         other arbitrary entangled state.  This can be achieved via quantum
         state teleportation. Quantum state teleportation consumes an unknown
         quantum state that we want to transmit and recreates it at the desired
         destination.</t>

         <t>To achieve this, a Bell Pair needs to be distributed between the
         source and destination.  The source then entangles the transmission
         qubit with its end of the Bell Pair and performs a measurement.  This
         consumes the Bell Pair's entanglement turning the source and
         destination qubits into independent states.  However, this process
         transforms the Bell Pair's qubit at the destination into the
         transmission qubit's original state.  Note he process requires the
         source to also communicate its two-bit measurement result so that the
         destination can correct for the randomness of the outcome.</t>

         <t>The unknown quantum state that was transmitted never entered the
         network itself.  Therefore, the network needs to only be able to
         reliably produce Bell Pairs between any two nodes in the network.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Bell Pair links and entanglement swapping">
         <t>Reducing the problem to one of generating a Bell Pair state has
         facilitated the problem, but it has not solved it.</t>

         <t>The technology to generate a Bell Pair between two directly
         connected quantum nodes already exists and has been demonstrated in
         laboratory conditions <xref target="humph18"></xref>.  Interestingly,
         neither of the two qubits of the pair need to be transmitted any
         further.</t>

         <t>A Bell Pair between any two nodes in the network can be constructed
         from Bell Pairs generated along each individual link on the path
         between the two end-points.  Each node along the path can consume the
         two Bell Pairs on the two links that it is connected to in order to
         produce a new Bell Pair between the two far ends.  This process is
         known as entanglement swapping.  Pictorially it can be represented as
         follows:</t>

         <figure align="center">
           <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
 x~~~~~~~~~~~~~x x~~~~~~~~~~~~~x
[ ]-----------[   ]-----------[ ]
           ]]></artwork>
         </figure>

         <t>where x~~x denotes a Bell Pair with individual qubits represented
         by x, -- denotes a quantum link, and [ ] denotes a node.  The diagram
         above represents the situation after the middle node has generated a
         Bell Pair with two of its directly connected neighbours.  Now, the
         middle node performs an entanglement swap operation (the exact details
         of the mechanism are beyond the scope of this memo).  This operation
         consumes the two Bell Pairs and produces a new Bell Pair between the
         two far ends of this three-node network as follows:</t>

         <figure align="center">
           <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
 x~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~x
[ ]-----------[   ]-----------[ ]
           ]]></artwork>
         </figure>

         <t>The outcome is guaranteed to be a Bell Pair between the two end
         nodes, but which of the four possible Bell Pairs is produced is not
         deterministic.  However, the middle node will know which one was
         produced as the entanglement swap is a measurement operation that
         yields two classical bits.  The final state can be inferred from this
         two-bit readout.  Therefore, the middle node needs only to communicate
         the outcome over a classical channel to one or both ends who can apply
         a correction to transform the pair into any of its other forms (if so
         desired).</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Distillation">
         <t>Neither the Bell Pair or the swapping operations are lossless
         operations.  Therefore, with each link and each swap the quality of
         the state degrades.  However, it is possible to create higher quality
         Bell Pair states from two or more lower quality Bell Pair states.
         Therefore, once the quality loss over a given distance become
         prohibitive, additional redundancy may be used to restore the state
         quality.</t>
       </section>
     </section>

     <section title="Direct transmission vs. swapping">
       <t>Direct state transmission whilst simpler conceptually is much more
       demanding to implement reliably in practice which means that any
       near-term practical realisation is more likely to succeed if it is based
       on the Bell Pair and entanglement swapping architecture.  This is the
       architecture that we will focus on in the rest of this memo for
       practical reasons.</t>

       <t>Nevertheless, we are not entirely discarding the direct transmission
       proposal.  Whilst it does enable the fault-tolerant transmission of
       unknown quantum states, it might still be more beneficial to use it to
       distribute Bell Pairs instead.  Distributing Bell Pairs via direct
       transmission means that one can leverage the advantages of entanglement
       swapping which allows for paralellisation as the Bell Pairs can be built
       up from both ends simultaneously.  Furthermore, the generic nature of
       the Bell Pair means that a network may provision resources better before
       it receives any request.</t>

       <t>Where "App" is some application running over a quantum network,
       --CC-- denote classical communication links (e.g.  over the public
       Internet or a private LAN), and "QNet" is a generic network stack.
       Architectures for the network stack have been proposed already <xref
       target="meter13"></xref>, but their discussion is beyond the scope of
       this memo.  However, they all map onto this generic diagram.  Nodes
       within a quantum network that are capable of performing the entanglement
       swap operation are often referred to as quantum repeaters and we shall
       adopt this terminology from this point on.  End-hosts connecting at the
       edge of the network are not necessarily repeaters themselves.</t>

       <t>The key message here is that a network stack relies on the hardware
       being able to provide two services: Bell Pair generation across a link,
       and swap operation.  In any network model it is assumed that the
       physical device is capable of providing both of these services and
       offers a suitable interface for their usage.</t>

       <t>Strictly speaking quantum memories are not needed for a functional
       quantum network as long as the network is able to generate the Bell
       Pairs, swap the entanglement, and deliver the final Bell Pair to the
       application in a usable form.  However, in general, to be able to
       provide the two services above, the hardware will also need to be able
       to store the qubits in memory which is highly non-trivial.</t>

       <t>Furthermore, it is also assumed that the applications are able to
       communicate classically, and that the nodes themselves are also
       connected over some classical channel.  The classical links between the
       nodes need not always have an associated quantum link, but it is assumed
       that any quantum link has a classical link running in parallel.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Physical constraints">
       <t>The model above has effectively abstracted away the particulars of
       the hardware implementation.  However, certain physical constraints need
       to be considered in order to build a practical network.  Some of these
       are fundamental constraints and no matter how much the technology
       improves, they will always need to be addressed.  Others are artefacts
       of the early stages of a new technology.</t>

       <section title="Fidelity">
         <t>The quality of a quantum state is described by a physical quantity
         called fidelity.  Fidelity is the measure of how close a quantum state
         is to the quantum state we desire it to be in.  It expresses the
         probability that one state will pass a test to identify as the
         other.</t>

         <t>Fidelity is an important property of a quantum system that stems
         from the fact that no physical operation is perfect.  Furthermore,
         applications will in general require the fidelity of a quantum state
         to be above some minimum threshold in order to guarantee the
         correctness of their algorithm and it is the responsibility of the
         network to provide such a state.</t>

         <t>Additionally, entanglement swap operations, even if perfect, lead
         to a further reduction in the fidelity of the final state.  Two
         imperfect Bell Pairs when combined will produce a slightly worse Bell
         Pair.  Whilst distillation is one of the available mechanisms to
         correct for these errors it requires additional Bell Pairs to be
         produced.  There will be a trade-off between how much distillation is
         to be done versus what fidelity is acceptable.</t>

         <t>This is a fundamental constraint as perfect noiseless operations
         and lossless communication channels are unachievable. Therefore, no
         Bell Pair will be generated with perfect fidelity and the network must
         account for this.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Memory lifetimes">
         <t>In addition to discrete operations being imperfect, storing a qubit
         in memory is also highly non-trivial.  The main difficulty in
         achieving persistent storage is that it's extremely challenging to
         isolate a quantum system from the environment.  The environment
         introduces an uncontrollable source of noise into the system which
         affects the fidelity of the state.  This process is known as
         decoherence.  Eventually, the state has to be discarded once its
         fidelity degrades too much.</t>

         <t>The memory lifetime depends on the particular physical setup, but
         the highest achievable values currently are on the order of hundreds
         of milliseconds.  These values have increased tremendously over the
         lifetime of the different technologies and are bound to keep
         increasing.  However, if quantum networks are to be realised in the
         near future, they need to be able to handle short memory lifetimes.
         An architecture that handles short lifetimes may also be more
         cost-efficient in the future.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Rates">
         <t>Entanglement generation on a link between two connected nodes is
         not a very efficient process and it requires many attempts to succeed.
         A fast repetition rate for Bell Pair generation is achievable, but
         only one in a few thousands will succeed.  Currently, the highest
         achievable rates of success are of the order of 10 Hz.  Combined with
         short memory lifetimes this leads to very tight timing windows to
         build up network-wide connectivity.  Achievable rates are likely to
         increase with time, but just like with quantum memories, it may be
         more cost-efficient in the future to provide low-rate links in some
         parts of the network.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Communication qubit">
         <t>Some physical architectures are not able to generate entanglement
         using any memory qubit that they have access to.  In these systems,
         entanglement is generated using a communication qubit and once a Bell
         Pair has been generated, the qubit state is transferred into memory.
         This may impose additional limitations on the network.  In particular
         if a given node has only one communication qubit it cannot
         simultaneously generate Bell Pairs over two links.  It must generate
         entanglement over the links one at a time.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Homogeneity">
         <t>Currently all hardware implementations are homogeneous and they do
         not interface with each other.  In general, it is very challenging to
         combine different quantum information processing technologies due to
         their sensitivity to losses.  Coupling different technologies with
         each other is of great interest as it may help overcome the weaknesses
         of the different implementations, but this is not a near-term
         goal.</t>
       </section>
     </section>

     <section title="Architectural principles">
       <t>Given that the most practical way of realising quantum network
       connectivity is using Bell Pair and entanglement swapping repeater
       technology what sort of principles should guide us in assembling such
       networks such that they are functional, robust, efficient, and most
       importantly: they work.  Furthermore, how do we design networks so that
       they work under the constraints imposed by the hardware available today,
       but do not impose unnecessary burden on future technology.  Redeploying
       network technology is a non-trivial process.</t>

       <t>As this is a completely new technology that is likely to see many
       iterations over its lifetime, this memo must not serve as a definitive
       set of rules, but merely as a general guide based on principles and
       observations made by the community.  The benefit of having a community
       built document at this early stage is that expertise in both quantum
       information and network architecture is needed in order to successfully
       build a quantum internet.</t>

       <section title="Goals of a quantum internet">
         <t>When outlining any set of principles we must ask ourselves what
         goals do we want to achieve as inevitably trade-offs must be made.  So
         what sort of goals should drive a quantum network architecture?  The
         following list has been inspired by the history of the classical
         Internet, but it will inevitably evolve with time and the needs of its
         users.  The goals are listed in order of priority which in itself may
         also evolve as the community learns more about the technology.</t>

         <t>
           <list style="numbers">
             <t>Support distributed quantum applications
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             The primary purpose of a quantum internet is to run distributed
             quantum algorithms and it is of utmost importance that they can
             run well and efficiently.  Therefore, the needs of quantum
             applications should always be considered first.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             If a network is able to distribute entanglement it is officially
             quantum.  However, if it is unable to distribute these states with
             a sufficiently high fidelity at a reasonable rate for a majority
             of potential applications it is not practical.</t>

             <t>Support tomorrow's distributed quantum applications
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             There are many applications already proposed to run over a quantum
             internet.  However, more algorithms will be invented as the
             community grows as well as the robustness and the reliability of
             the technology.  Any proposed architecture should not constrain
             the capabilities of the network for short-term benefit.</t>

             <t>Hardware heterogeneity
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             There are multiple proposals for realising practical quantum
             repeaters and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. It
             is also very likely that the most optimal technologies in the
             future will be hybrid combinations of the many different solutions
             currently under development.  It should be an explicit goal of the
             architecture to allow for a large variety of hardware
             implementations.</t>

             <t>Be flexible with regards to hardware capabilities and
             limitations
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             This goal encompasses two important points.  First, the
             architecture should be able to function under the physical
             constraints imposed by the current generation hardware.  Second,
             it should not make it difficult to run the network over any
             hardware that may come along in the future.  The physical
             capabilities of repeaters will improve and redeploying a
             technology is extremely challenging.</t>

             <t>Security, availability, and resilience
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Whilst the priority for the first quantum networks should be to
             simply work, we cannot forget that ultimately they have to also be
             secure.  There are three key security considerations at the
             network level, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Confidentiality and integrity - it is vital that the network can
             provide a reasonable guarantee of the minimum fidelity of a
             delivered Bell Pair as the application's own security mechanisms
             rely on this.  Uncertainty about the fidelity of a Bell Pair may
             potentially expose its data to an eavesdropper.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Authenticity - it is important that any application can have
             confidence that the other end of the Bell Pair has been delivered
             to the desired partner.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Additionally a practical and usable network is able to continue to
             operate despite losses and failures, and will be robust to
             malicious actors trying to disable connectivity.  These may be
             simply considered different aspects of security, but it is
             worthwhile to address them explicitly at the architectural level
             already.</t>

             <t>Easy to manage and monitor
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Quantum networks rely on complex physical phenomena and require
             hardware that is challenging to build.  Furthermore, the quantum
             resources will at first be very scarce and potentially very
             expensive.  This entails a need for a robust management solution.
             It is important that a good management solution needs to come with
             adequate monitoring capabilities.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Good management solutions may also be key to optimising the
             networks which in turn may be crucial in making them economically
             feasible.  Unlike user data that is transmitted over classical
             networks, quantum networks only need to generate generic Bell
             Pairs.  This leaves a lot of room for pre-allocating resources in
             an efficient manner.</t>
           </list>
         </t>
       </section>

       <section title="The principles of a quantum internet">

         <t>The principles support the goals, but are not goals themselves.
         The goals define what we want to build and the principles provide a
         guideline in how we might achieve this.  The goals will also be the
         foundation for defining any metric of success for a network
         architecture, whereas the principles in themselves do not distinguish
         between success and failure.</t>

         <t>
           <list style="numbers">
             <t>Bell Pairs are the fundamental building block
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             The key service that a quantum network provides is the
             distribution of entanglement between the nodes in a network.  This
             point additionally specifies that the entanglement is primarily
             distributed in the form of the entangled Bell Pair states which
             should be used as a building block in providing other services,
             including more complex entangled states.</t>

             <t>Fidelity is part of the service
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             In addition to being able to deliver Bell Pairs to the
             communication end-points, the Bell Pairs must be of sufficient
             fidelity.  However, different applications will have different
             requirements for what fidelity they can work with.  It is the
             network's responsibility to balance the resource usage with
             respect to the application's requirements.  It may be that it is
             cheaper for the network to provide lower fidelity pairs that are
             just above the threshold required by the application than it is to
             guarantee high fidelity pairs to all applications regardless of
             their requirements.</t>

             <t>Bell Pairs are indistinguishable
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Any two Bell Pairs between the same two nodes are
             indistinguishable for the purposes of an application provided they
             both satisfy its required fidelity threshold.  This point is
             crucial in enabling the reuse of resources of a network and for
             the purposes of provisioning resources to meet application
             demand.</t>

             <t>Time as an expensive resource
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             With the current technology, time is the most expensive resource.
             It is not the only resource that is in short supply (memory, and
             communication qubits are as well), but ultimately it is the
             lifetime of quantum memories that imposes the most difficult
             conditions for operating an extended network of quantum nodes.
             Current hardware has low rates of Bell Pair generation, short
             memory lifetimes, and access to a limited number of communication
             qubits.  All these factors combined mean that even a short waiting
             queue at some node could be enough for the Bell Pairs to decohere.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             However, time is only expensive once quantum operations are
             underway.  If no quantum operations are currently being processed
             then the network can use this time to prepare and provision
             resources.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             As hardware improves, the need for carefully timing quantum
             operations may become smaller.  It is currently unknown what the
             cost of these improvements will be, but it is conceivable that
             there is value in having relatively cheap and undemanding links
             connected at the edges of a network which will have very short
             memory lifetimes and low rates of Bell Pair generation.</t>

             <t>Limit classical communication
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             This point offers a practical guideline to the issue of timing.
             A bottleneck in many quantum networked algorithms is the classical
             communication needed between quantum operations to synchronise
             state.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             For example, some quantum protocols may need to perform a correct
             for the random outcome of a quantum measurement.  For this, they
             will block the state from further operations until a classical
             message is received with the information necessary to perform the
             correction.  The time during which the quantum state is blocked is
             effectively wasted.  It reduces the time available for subsequent
             operations possibly rendering the state useless for an
             application.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Trade-offs that allow a protocol to limit the number of blocking
             classical communication rounds once quantum operations have
             commenced will in general be worth considering.</t>

             <t>Parallelise quantum operations
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             A further point to address the issue of timing constraints in the
             network.  The Bell Pairs on the individual links need not be
             generated one after another along the path between the
             communication end-points.  The order does not matter at all.
             Furthermore, the order of the swap operations is flexible as long
             as they don't reduce the fidelity too much.  Parallelising these
             operations is key to optimising quantum protocols.</t>

             <t>Avoid time-based coordination when possible
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             A solution to timing constraints is to synchronise clocks and
             agree on the timing of events.  However, such solutions have
             several downsides.  Whilst network clock synchronisation may be
             accurate enough for certain purposes it introduces an additional
             element of complexity, especially when multiple nodes in different
             networks must be synchronised.  Furthermore, clock synchronisation
             will never be perfect and it is conceivable that hardware
             capabilities advance so much that time-based mechanisms
             under-utilise resources in the more efficient parts of the
             network.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Nevertheless, it may not be possible to avoid clocks, but such
             solutions should be adequately justified.</t>

             <t>Pre-allocate resources
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Regardless of what application is running over the network it will
             have the same needs as any other application: a number of Bell
             Pairs of sufficient fidelity.  Whilst the fidelity is a variable
             number, the indistinguishability of Bell Pairs means that there is
             lots of flexibility in how a network may provision resources to
             meet demand.  The additional timing constraints mean that
             pre-allocation of resources will be central to a usable quantum
             network.</t>

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
